## Project Description:
Developed a decentralised application using Blockchain to address the shortcomings of the current land registry process. It is possible to keep track of how property changes hands via Blockchain. It is simpler for buyers, sellers, and government registrars to transfer land ownership from a seller to a new buyer without the use of intermediaries. It offers immutability, auditability, traceability, and anonymity, which entices people all over the world to use its decentralisation feature in the land registry process. It also speeds up the registration process and increases system transparency.
